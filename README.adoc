== Overview

A simple Dockerfile parser written in ReasonML, and usable as both a library as well as a program.

== Current status & usage:

The library provides a function, `string_of_docker`, that can generate Dockerfile lines, although it cannot currently round-trip.

[source,reasonml]
----
let src = [Arg("version", "10"), RunCommand("wc -l")]
List.iter((x) => {
    print_endline(longshoreman,string_of_docker(x))
}, src)
----

Reading the https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#format[Dockerfile specification], I don't know if I will actually
support round tripping the code; instead, I'll probably focus on accurately parsing & canonicalizing, rather than round trip
accuracy

Additionally, `docker_of_string` is provided to parse Docker lines into `t` objects that can be used:

[source,reasonml]
----
let d = docker_of_line({|CMD ["/bin/sh" , "-c" , "echo test" ]|}, 0); <1>
----
<1>: returns a `CMDArray` ADT
