== Overview

A simple Dockerfile parser written in ReasonML, and usable as both a library as well as a program.

== Current status & usage:

The library provides a function, `string_of_docker`, that can generate Dockerfile lines, although it cannot currently round-trip.

[source,reasonml]
----
let src = [Arg("version", "10"), RunCommand("wc -l")]
List.iter((x) => {
    print_endline(longshoreman,string_of_docker(x))
}, src)
----

Reading the https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#format[Dockerfile specification], I don't know if I will actually
support round tripping the code; instead, I'll probably focus on accurately parsing & canonicalizing, rather than round trip
accuracy
